# Some Exercises in Rust

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises and projects from the Udemy's [Rust: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-the-complete-developers-guide/?couponCode=MT260825G1) 🎓.  The course provides a comprehensive introduction to Rust, covering **ownership, lifetimes, borrowing, traits, generics, error handling, modules**, and more. Here, you’ll find my implementations of the course challenges, structured by section.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a course module or project.  
- Code is written in **idiomatic Rust** and built with Cargo.  
- Solutions are intended for learning and practice — not official course material.  

## 🚀 Topics Covered
Some of the Rust concepts and features you’ll see in this repo:
- Ownership & Borrowing  
- Lifetimes  
- Traits & Generics  
- Pattern Matching  
- Error Handling (`Result` & `Option`)  
- Modules & Project Organization  
- Iterators  
- Common Data Structures  
- File I/O  

## ⚠️ Note
- These solutions reflect **my own learning path** through the course.  
- If you’re taking the course, I recommend attempting the exercises yourself before checking solutions.  
- This repo is not a replacement for the course — it’s just my personal study log.  

## 🔧 How to Run
Clone the repo and run any project with Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohsensadr/rust-exercises.git
cd rust-exercises/<project-folder>
cargo run
```
